<h2>History of Chess</h2>
<p>The game of Chess has been around for more than 1500 years.
The origins are still unknown, However, the earliest players can
be traced back to 7th century India. From there it was introduced to Persia.
In Persia, chess was primarily played by nobility. Persia contributed several factors
to the game, including the phrases "Shah"(Persian for "King") and "Shah Mat"(
Persian for "the King is helpless" or checkmate). After Persia was
conquered during an islamic conquest, Chess was introduced to the Muslim world. From There
Chess spread throughout Europe and eventually the entire globe.</p>
<h2>Chess pieces</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rook   &#9814;: The Rook can move any amount of space both vertically and
  horizontally.</li>
  <li>Knight &#9816;: The Knight can move in an L shape(1 space to the right/left then 2 spaces
  down/up)</li>
  <li>Bishop &#9815;: The Bishop can move diagonally on the board in any direction.</li>
  <li>Queen  &#9813;: The Queen, the most versatile of the pieces, can move vertically, horizontally
  diagonally in any direction.</li>
  <li>King   &#9812;: The king can move one space in any direction, the objective of the game is to capture
   the opponents king.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Assignment 1 steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Setting up the html file with a body, table and style section.</li>
  <li>Creating the numbered and lettered boarder within the table using "tr" for rows and
  "th" to create the headers within the rows</li>
  <li>Creating more rows using "tr" and inserting cells("td") to represent the spaces on the board </li>
  <li>Then I began styling the header cells and the board cells. To make the board cells alternate
   colors, I used the "nth-of-type" command.</li>
   <li>After styling the table I created a paragaph down below, briefly detailing the history of chess.
    I did this using the "p" tag.</li>
   <li>Below that I created a bulleted list using "ul" and "li", detailing the basic functionalities of
   the chess pieces.</li>
</ol>
